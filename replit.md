- **Evidence System**: Clear visibility into all subscriber activities and subscription statuses

### ðŸ”’ CRITICAL DATA ISOLATION FIX - August 2, 2025

**Issue Identified**: Severe data leakage between main user (Petrisor) and tenant databases
- Personal data (drivers like "Feleaga Cristian") was being copied to all tenant schemas
- Root cause: `seedDatabase()` function in routes.ts contained Petrisor's personal business data
- Violation of multi-tenant isolation principles - tenants should never see main user's data

**Actions Taken**:
- Removed all personal companies (Fast & Express S.R.L., Daniel Ontheroad S.R.L.) from tenant seeding
- Eliminated personal drivers from tenant databases (26+ records cleaned)
- Updated seeding to only include generic transport companies for tenants
- Maintained complete separation: Main user data stays in main schema only

**Trade-off**: Some legitimate drivers detected from uploaded TRIP files were accidentally removed
- These were drivers found in CSV uploads, not personal data
- User will need to re-upload and re-process TRIP files to restore detected drivers
- System now correctly maintains true multi-tenant isolation

### âœ… Complete Database Separation System - August 1, 2025 (UPGRADED)
- **MultiTenantManager**: Completely rewritten system for 100% database isolation
- **Separate PostgreSQL Schemas**: Each subscriber gets their own dedicated schema (tenant_[id])
- **Zero Data Sharing**: Complete isolation - no shared tables, no tenantId columns needed
- **Automatic Schema Creation**: Full table structure created per tenant automatically
- **Legacy User Protection**: Petrisor remains main user, all new users are subscribers
- **Up to 100 Tenants**: System designed to handle expected subscriber volume
- **Tenant Routes**: Dedicated API endpoints for multi-tenant management and statistics
- **Complete Isolation**: Each tenant has independent companies, drivers, payments, orders
- **Schema-Based Architecture**: PostgreSQL schemas provide true database separation
- **Dynamic Connection Management**: Automated connection pooling per tenant schema

### âœ… Advanced Multi-Tenant Architecture Implementation - August 1, 2025
- **MultiTenantManager Class**: Advanced database manager with schema isolation
- **TenantRoutes System**: Dedicated routing for tenant management and statistics  
- **Zero Shared Data**: No tenantId fields - complete schema separation
- **Automatic Registration Flow**: New users get separate database on signup
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections per tenant
- **Admin Statistics**: Real-time tenant system monitoring and management
- **Database Cleanup**: Proper connection management and schema deletion
- **Production Ready**: Designed for 100 concurrent tenant databases

The system now provides complete database isolation where each subscriber operates in a completely independent environment, with Petrisor maintaining access to the original system and all new users getting their own dedicated PostgreSQL schemas.
