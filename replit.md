## Recent System Completion - August 9, 2025

### ✅ Critical Driver Mapping Bug Fix - FULLY RESOLVED - August 10, 2025
- **CRITICAL BUG**: Tiberiu Iulian Ivan had conflicting mappings between static code (Fast Express) and database (WF SRL)
- **DATABASE WINS Rule**: Static mapping removed to ensure database mappings take priority  
- **Root Cause**: Static code mapping `"Tiberiu Iulian  Ivan": "Fast Express"` conflicted with DB record (WF SRL)
- **Solution**: Commented out static mapping to let database mapping take precedence
- **Result**: Tiberiu Ivan's trips now correctly assigned to WF SRL instead of Fast Express

### ✅ Financial Display Logic Corrections - FULLY RESOLVED - August 10, 2025
