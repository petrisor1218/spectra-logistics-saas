### Build Process

Railway uses the configured build process:
1. `vite build` - Builds React frontend to `/dist/public`
2. `esbuild server/index.ts` - Bundles Node.js backend to `/dist`
3. Serves frontend static files + API from single Express server

### Architecture

```
/client/               # React frontend source
/server/               # Node.js backend source  
/shared/               # Shared TypeScript types
/dist/public/          # Built frontend (production)
/dist/index.js         # Built backend (production)
```

### Database Schema

Each tenant gets a separate PostgreSQL schema:
- **Main user**: Uses original database schema
- **Tenants**: Each gets `tenant_[id]` schema with isolated data
- **Zero data sharing**: Complete isolation enforced

### Health Checks

- Endpoint: `/api/health`
- Returns: Server status, timestamp, environment
- Used by Railway for deployment health monitoring
